# 4Year2Degree: A Schedule Builder and Degree Check for M.E.T. EECS Students

4Year2Degree is a web application that allows a student to plan their coursework schedule for eight semesters and ensure that they fulfill all degree requirements by the end of their fourth year.

Additional Section:

Summers are not included as part of the schedule builder because students are expected to participate in "real world" experiences; however, it is recognized that students may take coursework alongside an internship or other experience (such as during travel abroad). These courses can be added in the "Additional" section to fulfill requirements. It should be noted that degree requirements satisfied by prior coursework, either in the form of AP credit or college credit, should also be put into this section.
